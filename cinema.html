    <h2><b><i>STORY :</i></b></h2>
    <p>
      Uncontrollable and aggressive, Ranvijay "Vijay" Singh "Balbir" is deeply devoted to his wealthy tycoon-father Balbir Rajdheer Singh, who helms Swastik Steels, a generational steel empire established by Balbir's father, Rajdheer Dodamal Singh. However, Balbir is extremely workaholic and allocates little attention to his family. When Vijay intimidates his sister Reet's bullies with his father's licensed AK-47, Balbir is enraged at having a "criminal" for a son and ousts him to a boarding school in the United States. He returns home after years on account of his father's sixtieth birthday and his feelings for his betrothed childhood sweetheart Gitanjali resurface. During Balbir's birthday party, Vijay indulges in a heated exchange with Reet's husband Varun and calls himself illegitimate when Balbir takes Varun's side, prompting the former to expel him from the household. Vijay marries Gitanjali, a Telugu girl, who calls off her wedding against her family's assent, and they move to the United States.
Eight years later, Vijay returns home with Gitanjali and their kids after Balbir falls prey to an assassination attempt at a golf club. He reconciles with his father and takes charge of the family and the company in his stead. Consumed with vengeance against those trying to kill his father, Vijay openly threatens to slit the throats of the perpetrators during a speech. Distrusting the guards employed for Balbir's security, Vijay seeks help from his second cousins living in their hometown, who leave their families for the time-being and accompany him. Vijay recruits Kailash Petkar, a body double who resembles Balbir, but Kailash is eventually killed by Asrar Haque, who is revealed to be involved in the earlier assassination attempt on Balbir. Discovering that Varun is involved with the perpetrators and was in touch with Asrar all along, Vijay publicly strangles him to death at a conference while Asrar, who is one of the audience members, watches on. Vijay and his cousins meet with Freddy, a notorious arms dealer, to receive a machine gun manufactured on Vijay's designs at a hotel. Asrar and his assailants pounce on the hotel but Vijay takes them down using the gun and eventually kills Asrar but is severely wounded and hospitalized. Balbir and the family realize that Vijay is left with a failed urinary system, a damaged sense of hearing and an urgent need for heart transplantation. Vijay's cold-blooded behaviour gradually damages his relationship with Gitanjali. Soon, he undergoes a successful transplantation.
In Scotland, Abrar Haque, Asrar's violent and mute elder brother, is informed of his death during his third wedding; he subsequently kills the messenger out of rage. While Vijay begins to recuperate, he is introduced to Zoya, the fiancee of his donor. He finds her attractive and they pursue an extra-marital affair. After a Rolls Royce gifted to her by Vijay explodes, Zoya confesses to Vijay that she was actually sent by Abrar to honey trap him and that Aziz, another younger brother of Abrar, underwent a plastic surgery to look like Vijay and subsequently kill Vijay's family under the guise of him. She also asserts that Abrar might be related to him and believes that they have caused the explosion. Vijay discloses to have been aware of her true purpose and reveals that he has played along to discover the mastermind's identity and caused the explosion himself; he then leaves her, asking her to go wherever she wants. Later, Rajdheer reveals that he had banished his younger brother Shamsher Singh from his family and business due to his immoral antics; his son, Azim, who had converted to Islam, came to ask for a share in the property but was refused by Balbir. A humiliated Shamsher immolated himself, rendering his grandson Abrar, the only witness, mute out of trauma. Vijay realizes that Abrar and his brothers have been trying to exact revenge.
Vijay confesses to being involved in an affair with Zoya to Gitanjali, who breaks down, states that his intense love for his father has destroyed his rationality and asks for divorce. The next day, Vijay and his cousins fly to Scotland in search of Abrar and reach his residence, only to find him and his brother Abid missing. Vijay threatens Abrar's three wives and one of them eventually reveals that he will be leaving the country soon; Vijay leaves to confront Abrar while Abrar's third wife, who has gone into labour, is admitted into an hospital. Vijay manages to obstruct Abrar's flight from taking off and they engage in a long vigorous duel on the runway. Amidst the fight, Vijay requests Abrar to put aside their differences and be like a family but is brushed off, prompting him to slit his throat as promised, killing him.
Vijay returns home and during Diwali, he discovers that Balbir has been suffering from stage four acute lymphoblastic leukemia and has only a few months to live. Vijay confronts Balbir for being ignorant to his love for him and Balbir seeks an apology from Vijay for his persistent insensitivity. While Vijay bitterly cries over his father's disease in front of Mishra, his father's family-like assistant, and his cousins, Gitanjali prepares to leave him with the kids. However, his son Abhay gets out of the car and runs towards him, followed by Gitanjali, and embraces him.
In a post-credits scene, in Istanbul, Aziz Haque has completely transformed himself to resemble Vijay; Zoya is pregnant but it is unclear about who among Vijay and Aziz is the father of the child. Aziz violently butchers two of Vijay's cousins and proposes marriage to Abrar's third wife, who gave birth to twins. He then sets out to seek vengeance against Vijay with Abid
